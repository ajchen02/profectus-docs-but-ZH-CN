# Introduction

Profectus is a web-based game engine. You can write your content using many built in features, write your own features, and build up complex gameplay quickly and easily.

The purpose of creating profectus was to create an easy to use engine that does not create a ceiling for a programmer's personal growth. This engine will grow in complexity with you, empowering you to create increasingly complex designs and mechanics.

#### Design Philosophies

While absolute purity is impossible, design decisions have been and will continue to be made using these principles in mind.

- An engine should be intuitive, and code readable without context
- An engine should not constrain a creator
- An engine should be consistent
- An engine should be extensible, and those extensions sharable
- An engine should be efficient
- An engine should report issues early and thoroughly
- Passing by reference is one honking great idea -- [let's do more of that](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)!
	- [Refs are better than reactive objects](https://dev.to/ycmjason/thought-on-vue-3-composition-api-reactive-considered-harmful-j8c)
